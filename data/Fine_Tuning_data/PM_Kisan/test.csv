Respected Sir,
Subject: Regarding violation of Right to Information rules by not responding to Right to Information applications within the stipulated time.

With reference to the above subject, approximately 4 applications were submitted online to the website of the Joint Director, Department of Agriculture, Chitradurga, regarding various schemes of Talya Farmer Contact Centre, Holalkere Taluk. However, the Public Information Officer is required to directly respond to the applicant within 30 days, but the Public Information Officer has violated the Right to Information Act rules by not providing information to the applicant even after 30 days. After filing the first appeal, the First Appellate Authority has also violated the Right to Information Act rules by not calling the Public Information Officer and the applicant for inquiry within the stipulated time. Therefore, I request you to take disciplinary action against the Public Information Officer of the Joint Director's Office, Department of Agriculture, and the Joint Director, who is the First Appellate Authority, and also to provide the information I have requested completely free of charge.

Respected Sir,

The amount for the 13th to 15th installments has not been credited. Therefore, the PM Kisan Samman Yojana shows FTO as 'No' for the 13th installment. In this regard, I have visited the concerned bank and completed NPCI and e-KYC. Relevant documents have been uploaded in PDF format. Now, the agricultural department officials are showing the amount for the 13th to 15th installments as 'No' in the FTO. I request the agricultural department officials to change the FTO to 'Yes' and credit the amount to my account. Please provide corrected information regarding this in the endorsement.",Agriculture Department/Department of Agriculture/PM-KISAN- Disbursement of financiall assistance to the farmers for purchase of agri-inputs./Issues related to subsidy amount/Amount not received
